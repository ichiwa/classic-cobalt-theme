# New Cobalt Theme Icon

This directory should contain an icon.png file (128x128 pixels) for the extension.

You can create a simple icon with:

- Background: #002240 (theme background color)
- Text: "NC" or a simple blue gradient
- Size: 128x128 pixels

For now, you can remove the "icon": "icon.png" line from package.json if you don't want to create an icon immediately.
